Simui has certain kewords in the class name which are used to create a grid. A .su-grid-fr4 container div will create a 4 Equal Grid blocks.

Let us analyse: .su-grid-fr4 container div, the last part fr4 is important!
Example #1 : Equal Columns (fr)
Fr : Mean equal columns (change it to : A to get 4 AUTO WIDTH COLUMNS e.g .su-grid-a4
4 : Mean four columns ( change it to any number from 1 to 12 for your desired grids)
