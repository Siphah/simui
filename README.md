# How it works

SIMUICODE has two Most Powerful features. 
1. Interactive HTML - it allows you to toggle class name for any element you want whenever a selected element is triggered ( it could be any JavaScript Trigger), just by writing a data-toggle ="id|classname|event" , where id - is an id of element you to toggle class on, class name -is one to be toggled ( could be custom or our SIMUICODE class name ) and finally, Event - could be any JS event.

2.Responsive HTML - it allows you to add class for certain break points without within your HTML code, eg data-info="max-767px#blue" means add a class name called 'blue'  only from devices starting from 767px and below.

3.It has class names which are written using BEM, and are easy to recall since they're in a certain pattern rather than being just name.

4.It works the best for custom design which is very specific, since it is a tool that provide a specific CSS/JS code needed with extra styles like padding, background color, as these type of properties tends to be brand specific.
